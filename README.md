OMG, just finished Wolf Man and, like, seriously... what a ride! I mean, the hair and teeth situation was something else, right? I was thinking halfway through like, did nobody give this dude a razor? 😂 But then again, it’s a whole curse thing, so who knows how that works. Anyway, I love how they really went all out with the creepy forest scenes – proper spooky vibes there!

Like, the thing that 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬s me up is how everyone’s just chill about a werewolf running around. Sure, let's just pop to the pub and chug a pint while a furry dude’s on the loose, no biggie. Maybe they should've 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   script and read through for better survival skills, LOL.

> And oh man, the transformation scenes... like, can’t lie, I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 through my fingers at some points. Does it make me weird that I felt kinda bad for the guy? It’s not like he signed up for the whole turn into a beast and howl at the moon gig. But still, if a dude starts sprouting fur, pretty sure the entire village would not stick around for that. Just sayin’.

Oh! Forgot to mention, we should totally 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again next week with wine. Think I missed half the dialogue the first time around because I was too busy freaking out. 😂 Like, keeping the popcorn businesses booming with all that stress munching.

Why did I randomly think of trying to write a line of code after this? Something like `void transformIntoWolfMan();` I sound like such a nerd now, oops.

Anyway, have you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 anything new lately? I swear, all these creature features have got me looking twice at the full moon 😂 Hit me up with recommendations, I'm on a roll!
